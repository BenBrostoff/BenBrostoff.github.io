 <h1 id = "center">What Is Pair Programming?</h1>


 <p id = "center"> <i>Pair programming is an interactive creation of code compiled jointly by a driver and navigator.</i></p>

        <li><b>What is a driver?</b> Similar to a golf driver, the driver in a pair programming session physically moves the proverbial ball forward. The driver is responsibile for writing code and executing the general vision of the navigator (oh, we'll get to that). The driver also assists in creating and refining this general vision. </li>
        <p></p>

       <li><b>What is a navigator?</b> The navigator is in some respects the hands that move the driver.The navigator develops a vision and generates ideas to achieve that vision. The driver writes the code to execute on the vision and ideas supporting it. Additionally, the navigator will review the code to reduce errors and act as quality control.</li>
       <p></p>
       
   
        <li><b>How do the driver and navigator work together?</b> Different pairs work differently together, but in general, the navigator and driver should supplement eachother through a bit of specialization of labor (although there is overlap in responsibilities). The navigator can purely focus on the strategic direction and vision of the code; the driver can work on writing the best and most error-free code possible with an end-goal in mind (with such end goal provided by the navigator). Pairs may switch roles or partially breach defined responsibilities. The individuals and their respective chemistry dictate how pair programming will commence.</li>

        <h1 id = "center">Why Is Pair Programming Important to Dev Bootcamp?</h1>

         <p id = "center"> <i>Teaching pair programming aligns with Dev Bootcamp's mission of teaching students fundamental software engineering practices.</i></p>

        <li><b>Pair Programming promotes programmers learning different roles.</b> A programmer's responsibilities are never static. There is a time to lead, and a time to follow; a time to dance, and a time to stand still. Playing the role of driver and playing the role of navigator are important experiences for a young coder to have, as a strong coder must be flexible and dynamic.</li>

        <p>
        <li><b>Pair Programming reinforces the importance of human interaction.</b> At its most basic roots, the success of the human species is rooted in peacefully and productively interacting with eachother. Pair programming not only promotes interaction but thinking-based and logic-based interaction. WE are interacting over ideas and implementation of ideas. We are learning to be successful with people who may differ from us in numerous respects; this is the foundation of teamwork.</li>
      <p>
        <li><b>Pair Programming is a fundamental tool in the overall toolbox of good programmers.</b> Studies have shown that pair programming, while producing less rapid results than traditional individual programming, produces better, higher quality code. Flow is more logical and code has fewer errors. A programmer who can pair is a programmer who can share the success of quality over speed of results.</li>
        <p>
          <li><b>This web page is the product of Gabe and my (Ben Brostoff) first pair programming experience</b>. I acted as navigator and Gabe acted as driver. This dynamic played out well, with Gabe proposing various solutions in CSS and HTML based on the wireframe I provided our group with. The web page in its final form looks very similar to how I drew it up in the wireframe, and Gabe deserves much of the credit for executing on this vision.</p>
