<h2> Exercise 1 </h2>

<p>Of the listed attributes, I'd go with personal development, autonomy and challenge.</p>


<h2> Exercise 2 </h2>

<p>Challenge is the key word in the meaning of life for me. To the extent humans overcome challenges, we progress as a species. I am only developing as an individual (personal development) and becoming self-sufficient (autonomy) to the extent that I challenge myself. I love a challenge.</p>


<h2> Exercise 3 </h2>

<p>Likely a 3 - a 5 would be a fully realized individual, which I am far from.</p>
