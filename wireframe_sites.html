<h1> Wireframing My Three Favorite Websites </h1>

<h2> Grantland </h2>

<p>Grantland is the centralized location on the internet for the best journalism and long-form pieces in sports and pop culture. The design of the site attempts to demonstrate to users where to find good long-form pieces on their favorite subjects through a variety of mediums (video, podcasts or traditional written form). As shown in the wireframe below, mediums and subjects are grouped and easily viewed.</p>

<h2> Amazon </h2>

<p> Amazon through website design attempts to steer users to its one-stop shop for virtually anything. In my opinion, Amazon attempts to seek user dependency through the website design. Once a user has a Kindle, a Fire TV and Amazon Prime, content is largely only available through Amazon. The Company has tailored the website to specific users; you can see in the wireframe below all the space devoted to user specific content (recently viewed and recommended specifically). </p>

<h2> Thrillist </h2>

<p> Although an auditory adjective, I would refer to the visual design of Thrillist's website as loud. There's a significant focus on short titles and huge visuals with lots of colors. Thrillist wants clicks to pictures that look interesting and trendy. More than the two sites above, the company is all about engrossing the eye rather than the mind. </p>
