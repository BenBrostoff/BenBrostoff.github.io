<h2 style = "text-align: center" style = "font-size: 1.4em"> April 20, 2014 - Pairing and Giving Feedback</h2>

<p>It’s an oft-mentioned issue in education, one that is beginning to gain some traction at the local and national levels and even at the White House: the lack of computer science built into the K-12 curriculum. I profess not to know whether “we” (and I suppose I mean the federal government) are on top of this issue, although Code.org and efforts like it seem like a start. This post is not meant to serve as a normative diagnosis of what we should be doing with regard to computer science education. Rather, it’s a relation of my own experience as a now aspiring programmer.</p>


<p> Pairing is difficult when the partners have (i) overlapping skill sets and (ii) when the partners may have differing visions of the objective of a particular assignment. The implications of (i) are obvious. With (ii), which I encountered this week, the partners meander about and do not communicate well because they have different objectives. </p>

<p> I like feedback because it is the driving force in me developing as an individual (assuming it's authentic and sincere). I have only received feedback from one DBC instructor, and it felt good to hear both praise and criticism. Praise makes you want to accentuate your strengths (I was told I was a goo leader); criticism drives you to resolve and eliminate your weaknesses (I was told my HTML / CSS skilss could be improved). 

<p> Next time I pair, I want to come in with the technical grasp to be an immediate value add. Technical expertise is the easiest way in my opinion to make your partner respect you. We are, after all, software engineers.</p>

<p> Writing feedback can be difficult because I have high regard for others' feelings. I know what it's like to be emotionally hurt, and I would never inflict that on someone else. However, honesty is key for growth, and I need to strike a balance between the two, which is inherently difficult. </p>

<p> Pairing should be empowering for both individuals. Both partners should feel uplifted and be able to claim they learned something from eachother.  I enjoy pairing because it's an intellectual exercise that in many respects involves emotionally connecting with people. Emotional connection and intellectual stimulation are goals worth reaching for in all walks of life. </p>
