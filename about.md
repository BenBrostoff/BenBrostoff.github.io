I'm an ex-banker turned software engineer. I graduated from Duke University in 2012 with a BS in Economics and worked for two years in Wells Fargo's Commerical Operating Asset Finance division. At present, I am an instructor for incoming students at [Dev Bootcamp's](http://devbootcamp.com/) New York office.
