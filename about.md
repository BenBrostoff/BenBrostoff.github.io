title: About
---

I'm an ex-banker turned software engineer. I graduated from Duke University in 2012 with a BS in Economics and worked for two years in Wells Fargo's Commerical Operating Asset Finance division. At present, I am a junior software engineer at <a href="http://www.wisertogether.com/" target="_blank">WiserTogether</a> and instructor for incoming students at <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp</a>.

Professionally, I mostly work in Ruby, Python and JavaScript; for fun and learning, I've been trying my hand at Clojure. Learning Clojure presents an opportunity for me to better understand two paradigms that have long fascinated me: Lisp and functional programming. 

I care deeply about improving as a programmer and am always looking for opportunities to learn something new. I have a passion for working on interesting problems that present unique challenges, in addition to the New England Patriots and <a href="http://somanycolors.org/" target="_blank"> computer-generated colors </a>. I like to read and am always looking for [book recommendations](/books).
