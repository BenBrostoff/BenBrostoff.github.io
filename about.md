I'm an ex-banker turned software engineer. I graduated from Duke University in 2012 with a BS in Economics and worked for two years in Wells Fargo's Commerical Operating Asset Finance division. At present, I am a junior software engineer at <a href="http://www.wisertogether.com/" target="_blank">WiserTogether</a> and instructor for incoming students at <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp</a>.
