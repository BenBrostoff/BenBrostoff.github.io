I am a junior software engineer at <a href="http://www.wisertogether.com/" target="_blank">WiserTogether</a>.

Professionally, I mostly work in Ruby, Python and JavaScript. I care deeply about improving as a programmer and am always looking for opportunities to learn something new. 

I have a passion for working on interesting problems that present unique challenges, in addition to <a href="https://github.com/BenBrostoff/draft-kings-fun" target="_blank">optimizing DraftKings lineups </a> and <a href="http://somanycolors.org/" target="_blank"> looking at computer-generated colors </a>. I like to read and am always looking for [book recommendations](/books). Shoot me an e-mail any time at <a href="mailto:ben.brostoff@gmail.com"> ben.brostoff [at] gmail [dot] com </a>.
