I am a software engineer at <a href="http://www.xlhybrids.com/" target="_blank">XL Hybrids</a>.

Professionally, I mostly work in Ruby, Python and JavaScript. I care deeply about improving as a programmer and am always looking for opportunities to learn something new.

I have a passion for working on interesting problems that present unique challenges. I like to read and am always looking for [book recommendations](/books). Shoot me an e-mail any time at <a href="mailto:ben.brostoff@gmail.com"> ben.brostoff [at] gmail [dot] com </a>.
