<div class="missionstatement">
	<p> I wanted the design for this site to be as minimalist as possible and not to overwhelm the reader. The nav bar contains links to sites with information about me as well as a PDF download of my resume. I have my email listed in several places: the nav bar, the mission statement and the footer. In short, the mission statement seeks to tell the reader what I have been and what I intend to be. The portfolio in the future will serve as evidence that I can be what I set out to be. </p>

	<p> Below is my initial attempt at wireframing the site. There's some work to do, but the below was a rough sketch. </p>
