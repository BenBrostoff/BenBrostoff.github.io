<h1> My Three Favorite Websites </h1>

<p><a href="http://www.grantland.com" target="_blank">Grantland</a></p>

<p>Grantland is the brainchild of Bill Simmons, a sports and pop culture writer for ESPN who I religiously followed from middle school to adulthood. I have always found the site visually stunning and love the red and black color scheme. The homepage has the articles the site more or less recommends you read, but the links to the main features, blogs, Bill Simmons authored articles, other contributors and video features and square tiles at the top. As you scroll down, there's a latest section, a podcast section and a large block quote that shows a particularly good piece of writing. On first glance, I'm usually drawn to the main article Grantland is promoting; standing back, the Grantland red block letter logo is extremely noticeable and well crafted; a good piece of branding. 
</p>

<p> Five adjectives I'd used to describe Grantland visually: clean, precise, exquisite, fashionable and simple. Just look at the alignment and blocks; it's wonderful. </p>


<p> Five adjectives I'd use to describe Grantland on content: smart, funny, consistent, quirky and relevant. These adjectives pair well and sort of contrast well with the visual adjectives. It's the idea that the writing jumps off the page but is visually neat and organized. People I respect are reading Grantland. This is the de facto source for good long form sports and culture pieces of writing. And that's the problem the website solves: where on the internet can I find good journalism on a daily basis for sports and pop culture? </p>

<p> It's easy to find what you want on Grantland. Major sections are organized at the top bar. There is a search function (although I rarely use it). Content is grouped by both author and topic.</p>

<p> After reading grantland, I generally feel smarter. The authors are well versed in whatever topic they're discussing and give you a cohesive and full fledged picture. It really in my mind is the anti CNN or CNBC, although with admittedly lighter topics to discuss. <p/>

<p> Grantland sells ad space (Subway and Dove appear to be the main sponsors) and their quarterly print editions. They are not too in your face on the quarterly - I've looked at it at bookstores and considered purchasing before. </p>


<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon</a></p>

<p>I have "The Everything Store" by Brad Stone recently and have been a long-time Amazon user since high school; I have the utmost respect for the company, whose success in part largely depends on clean and easy to use user experience and website design. I go to this site on a weekly basis for all my book and other needs - its ease of use is tremendous and its proprietary algorithms for finding products I might not know about never ceases to amaze me. </p>

<p> The first thing I see now when I go to Amazon's homepage is the full-blown effort to promote the Amazon Fire TV, and the $99 price point. Jeff Bezos has a full multi paragraph letter fawning over how great the TV is. Taking a step back, there are other promotions for the Kindle Fire HDX, Gillette products, spring products - all advertisements are grouped on a right sidebar. The left sidebar allows you to shop by department and is a drop down menu with pseudo linking such that larger drop down menus appear by hovering over individual links. </p>

<p> Five visual adjectives: well-spaced, stunning, elegant, breath-taking and organized. I feel like this represents the best web design humanity has to offer. </p>

<p> Five content-based adjectives: to the point, thought-out, coherent, not salesy (meaning it doesn't feel like the company is pitching you all the time), futuristic. Bezos set out to make Amazon into the Everything store and the content makes it feel like a one-stop shop. The mission of the site is to reduce friction in your life. No more shopping around strip malls endlessly and feeling like you're wasting your time. Additionally, no more getting hosed because the reviews are excellent and crowd-sourced. The best product wins on Amazon. Like Grantland, the visual goes hand in hand with content. Because the website visually makes sense and is nice to look at, the content speaks and you're attracted to use the product. </p>

<p> Navigation and ease of use are A+s. It is easy to navigate back and forward, and products are grouped based on a variety of clusters: category, relation to what you have previously bought, sales promotions, etc. Amazon can be overwhelming but only because you're realizing a website like this exists. </p>

<p> Admittedly, there have been times on Amazon I feel like I've been on buying sprees without purpose. But when I buy books I generally always feel as though I'm enriching my mind, so the Amazon experience leaves me feeling intellectually satisfied. Books are extremely afffordable also (especially Kindle versions), so I never feel like I've been robbed. </p>

<p> Amazon sells (almost) everything. And it does a damn good job letting you know about it in a non-intrusive way. </p>


<p><a href="http://www.thrillist.com" target="_blank">Thrillist</a></p> 

<p> I did not know Thrillist existed until I went through a head-hunting / educational type service that promoted Thrillist as a company it had placed a number of clients at. The website quite simply is visually awesome. I have never bought anything from it (it's trendy men's products, and I'm pretty mild mannered on the fashion front), but it is ane experience to look at. </p>

<p> Thrillist hits you with a Business Insidery headline and huge banner upon opening the website (17 Things You Need to Explain...). I find stuff like this annoying and insulting to my intelligence. Stepping back, there are lots of pictures and teasers for articles. The pictures are extremely colorful and eye catching. They are labeled by city and it'd be easy to click on one if you were visiting New York or LA and looking for a good bar to go to. </p>

<p> Five visual adjectives: colorful, chaotic, trendy, hip and fun. </p>

</p> Five content based adjectives: in-your-face, spirited, vernacular, casual and exotic. This website is all about promoting itself as the de facto source for men's fashion without seeming self-righteous. Again, the visual is selling you a lifestyle, which supplements the content, which is giving you a how and why.<p>

<p> Fairly easy to navigate; the main content area displays articles and a sidebar usually has related articles or things to buy. Interestingly, the sidebar disappears and reappears depending on how deep you are int he Thrillist hierarchy. If you are on a main section with no article displayed, the sidebar disappears. Sometimes the entire sidebar is replaced by enormous ads. In general, the amount of flashy colors and ads in this website can wear at the user, but the experience is certainly different and worth having from time to time. I mainly use Thrillist for shopping evaluation (again, have never bought anything), so I know how to click on the shop tab.</p>

<p>  After being on Thrillist, I feel tired and ready to return to my boringly styled self. I often feel I have neither the patience nor time to keep up with men's fashion. But it is fun to take a gander at. Thrillist sells a trendy lifestyle I feel lukewarm about but am amused by. </p>
