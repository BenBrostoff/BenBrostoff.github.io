            Computer Science Education
          </h1>
          <p>It&rsquo;s an oft-mentioned issue in education, one that is beginning to gain some traction at the local and national levels and even at the White House: the lack of computer science built into the K-12 curriculum. I profess not to know whether &ldquo;we&rdquo; (and I suppose I mean the federal government) are on top of this issue, although Code.org and efforts like it seem like a start. This post is not meant to serve as a normative diagnosis of what we should be doing with regard to computer science education. Rather, it&rsquo;s a relation of my own experience as a now aspiring programmer.</p>

<p>I had never coded until my sophomore year of college. Until my intro Java class at Duke, I could not tell you a single programming language, how software was written, the difference between desktop and web-based software, etc. My understanding of the internet was more or less limited to the websites I visited and the applications I used. When I received my first smartphone at age 21, the entire transition seemed rather natural. Oh, now I have this piece of superior technology that everyone else has. I am more in awe of mobile apps now than I was in three years ago because I&rsquo;m only just beginning to understand their origins and power. Indeed, I&rsquo;m only just beginning to hear and understand computer science terms that are fundamental to how we conduct our daily lives.</p>

<p>I look back at my K-12 education and try to piece together exactly why I never looked into or learned about computer science or programming. There are the obvious answers of course: no classes were offered, my parents, siblings and friends had no interest in programming computers, etc. The obvious answers in retrospect do not really hold weight, in that I now wonder why I had no interest in how computers worked.</p>

<p>I played through some of The Way Things Work (David Macaulay and Neil Ardley) as a child. I asked questions about the seasons, light bulbs, cars, and all the other things a child might be interested in. Fascinatingly, though, it never really occurred to me to ask how pixels formed on a screen (be it TV or computers), or why I could click on At Ease icons on our family&rsquo;s old Mac and be brought to a variety of different places, or how CDs or floppy disks were so small but held so much data (and little did I know that those things would be gargantuan by today’s standards).</p>

<p>In what I remember of my elementary and middle school years, adults sometimes liked to pose the “how does X work” questions and provide the answers. Most science teachers served this function. But computers rarely came under the line of questioning. Even as massive technological changes (by my standards) happened under my nose, adults never really provided commentary or answers. One day it just so happened that your sister could pick up the phone while you were on the internet and nothing would happen. The next day there was no America Online CD or seven step log-in process - you just clicked on a Microsoft Explorer icon and you were online. You don’t need to page your mother anymore, Benjamin - you can text her on this new phone that fits in your pocket. Thanks, Dad.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m not suggesting here it&rsquo;s an adult&rsquo;s responsibility to inform children of why and how certain things are happening in the world. I&rsquo;m an adult now and could not bear this responsibility. But why don&rsquo;t we, the community of adults, feel at all obligated to explain certain elements of technology to our children?</p>

<p>At a certain level, children interpret this indifference to mean &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not all that important&rdquo; (or at least I did). In part because no one really made me give notice to changes in computers, the internet, AI, mobile phones, etc., I ignored it and moved along. My working assumption was calculus, physics, and even classic novels were &ldquo;more important&rdquo; - here is where my attentions should be focused on. </p>

<p>I find myself now in a weird state of affairs - a 24 year old adult with a new child like curiosity in computers. I find myself marveling at previous things I held to be normal. The mere fact that every pixel on your screen is controlled by an algorithm elicits wonder. Now that I know the difficult in coding a basic tic-tac-toe bot, I can be floored by alpha-beta pruning in chess algorithms.</p> 

<p>I wonder often how my views on the world would have been shaped had I learned to code at a yong age. Brian Fitzpatrick, in his interview in Peter Seibel&rsquo;s <i> The Art of Coding</i>, provides a bit of color here:</p>

<blockquote class = "blogpost">This was one of my first programs-it was something like K equals grab the next char. Then I said if K equals &ldquo;a&rdquo;, print &ldquo;a&rdquo;; if K is &ldquo;b&rdquo;, print &ldquo;b&rdquo;. I pretty much did every letter, number, and some punctuation. Then at one point I was like, &ldquo;Wait, I could just say, `Print the variable!&rdquo;&lsquo; and I replaced 40 lines of code with one. I was like, &ldquo;Holy shit, that was awesome!&rdquo; That was some major abstraction for a six year old. </blockquote>

<p>Although this particular quote seems pretty funny at first glance, it’s also somewhat incredible a six year old can come to an important realization about the world at large through programming. The insight about variables here is one you could easily imagine being important in any discipline: the idea that one thing can stand for many things. Indeed, there&rsquo;s no question such an insight requires a higher level of thinking than most six year olds are capable of. That passage alone is proof many times over that we as an &ldquo;adult society&rdquo; need to introduce children to porogramming as early as possible.</p>

<p>Coding develops new branches in the mind. Anyone who knows how to program thinks about the world differently. Fundamentally, how one perceives the relationship between humans and machines is largely a function of their experience in programming. Imagine writing a critical review of The Matrix. Your opinion on that movie to a certain extent has to be dictated by your knowledge of computer programming. </p>

<p>When I see any device reliant on being &ldquo;programmed&rdquo;, I start to think about how. Classes, methods, variables, conditionals, etc. My appreciation for these devices is an infinite order of times larger than before I started to study programming; my interest in them has been inifinitely magnified as well.</p>  

<p>I find new historical figures that in my adulthood are the Michael Jordans and Tom Bradys of my youth. John McCarthy. Donald Knuth. Hal Ableson. Gerald Jay Sussman. Paul Graham. The intelligence of these guys makes them something else in my mind: worthy of being on the same plane as a Franklin, an Edison or a Tesla.</p>

<p>All of the above is really to say that programming and the study of computer science has had a profound impact on my life. I feel excited every day to continue improving as a programmer and learn more about the history and future of computer science. One of the greatest gifts we as adults can pass onto our children is this education. </p>
