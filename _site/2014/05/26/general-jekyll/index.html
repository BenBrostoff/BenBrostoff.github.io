            Migration to Jekyll
          </h1>
          <p>There are few things in life I dislike more than repetitive processes that could be automated where I learn very little (recall I&rsquo;m a former investment banking analyst). My initial construction of a personal blog met this criteria. </p>

<p>I was working with a bunch of HTML and CSS files I had coded myself. Every blog post was an individual HTML page - if I wanted to make a change to the header, footer or general layout of my site, I had no choice but to change every single page. One can imagine how annoying this process became as my blog expanded. There were also a host of smaller issues that bothered me: </p>

<ul>
<li>I had to manually type in the dates and times of my posts</li>
<li>My site looked terrible on mobile and tablet devices</li>
<li>I was not pleased with the hierarchy of folders and each file&rsquo;s place in the hierarchy I made up. Yet, if I wanted to change the set-up, I would have to relink every HTML page accordingly.</li>
<li>I was spending more time on layout decisions (the classic border, padding, margin debacle) and CSS shenanigans (color schemes, hover links, shapes, etc.) than I was on writing</li>
</ul>

<p>Constructing quality blog posts (mini-essays in some cases) is a labor of love for me and something I&rsquo;ve done since I learned to write. Pre-internet, I was journaling obsessively and documenting all the inane events interesting to a sports-obsessed grade schooler (if you want to hear about Antoine Walker&rsquo;s second go-around with the Celtics wherein he changed his number to 88 to accomodate Big Al Jefferson, by all means, swing by). I have experience in writing and editing my own writing (as well as others&#39; writing) - I wrote for my local newspaper in highschool and was the Editorial Pages Editor and a <a href="https://www.dukechronicle.com/staff/ben-brostoff/articles">columnist for three years for the Duke Chronicle</a>. I&rsquo;m very comfortable writing - I&rsquo;m less comfortable managing an entire website.</p>

<p>Enter <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Jekyll is a simple Ruby gem you install via your Terminal. By creating a new project through Jekyll, you get a working template with a ready-to-go setup that&rsquo;s easily customizable. The Jekyll new project folder reminds me a bit of a new Ruby on the Rails project in that you have a nicely organized hierarchy that lends itself to easy changes. Below is a screenshot of a new Jekyll project on my desktop: </p>

<p>From there, it&rsquo;s easy to fool around with config.yml, layouts and css to change your blog as you please. A massive amount of Jekyll work is posted on Github, so it&rsquo;s also easy to leverage off the work of your Jekyll predecessors. I actually cloned the <a href="https://github.com/muan/scribble">Scribble theme created by Mu-an Chiou from GitHub</a> and customized it a bit - thanks again Mu-an. </p>

<p>Since I migrated to Jekyll, I&rsquo;ve found myself spending considerably less time on blog design and layout and considerably more time on writing. I&rsquo;m biased, but I feel the quality of my writing on this blog has in part improved because of Jekyll.</p>
