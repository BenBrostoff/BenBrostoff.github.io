          </h1>
          <p class = "blogpost">June 2nd marks the beginning of my DBC cohort date in New York.</p>

<p class = "blogpost">To be frank, I feel I&rsquo;m not exagerrating when I claim that signing up for DBC was the most difficult decision of my life (which goes to show you the relative lack of events that have occurred in my life thus far). I left a comfortable job in Wells Fargo&rsquo;s asset-backed finance division in Charlotte, where I very much liked my colleagues and was well practiced at the investment banking duties associated with the position.</p>

<p class = "blogpost">Yet, computer science and programming I had flirted with for several years, and I found as time progressed it was a flirtation that turned into something far more powerful. I am someone with a natural inclination to take things apart and figure out how they work. I like to draw; I love to build; I live to write.</p>

<p class = "blogpost">I dabbled in a few CS classes at Duke and wish I had done more - the reason I didn&rsquo;t I can purely attribute to already having achieved an Economics degree in my junior year and naturally assuming I would have some type of career in business / finance. Besides, I got A&rsquo;s in all my economics classes and B&rsquo;s in the CS I took (basic Java, discrete mathematics)&hellip; but perhaps this was to be expected due to Duke&rsquo;s massive grade inflation in the former and lack thereof in the latter.</p>

<p class = "blogpost">In reflecting, I&rsquo;ve come to realize that my work in banking convinced me I was <i> good </i> at something. It was easy to put together slide decks and elementary models and write credit memos once I had done it for a year. The volume of work I did created something like fulfillment in my life.</p>

<p class = "blogpost">I know intimately, though, that work for work&rsquo;s sake is surface fulfillment. Volume is not quality. And having one&rsquo;s work be both challenging and intellectually stimulating in part renders work meaningful. Moreover, work needs to serve a greater purpose - chiefly, the advancement of technology that benefits all.</p>

<p class = "blogpost">I&rsquo;m a firm believer in one&rsquo;s job being tied to one&rsquo;s passion, if not the exact same. I consider computers humanity&rsquo;s most wonderful and incredible invention, and I would be amiss if I did not gain an education in how to use them to their fullest extent: writing useful software. I am proud to undertake the craft of software engineering, and excited for the challenge that lies ahead.</p>

<p class = "blogpost">I covered in a previous post the idea of stereotype threat. It seems to me that stereotype threat covers not only groups of people, but ideas. I once believed that we should do what we&rsquo;re &ldquo;good&rdquo; at. It seems logical that what I displayed a talent for should be my vocation. Experience has borne out the idea that motivation is intimately tied to intellectual curiousity and pursuing challenges that push us as thinkers. Computer science and programming has given me an intellectual motivation that economics never did, and I welcome my pending career change.</p>
