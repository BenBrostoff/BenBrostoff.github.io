            Dealing With Conflict
          </h1>
          <p>I used to play basketball with a couple guys at the local JCC a few mornings a week before work. The level of play was actually pretty elevated, and there were a couple guys who had played in college. The catch here was that everyone was late thirties and up, and as someone in their early 20s, I was generally quicker and more athletic than most due to my youth. I was a valued commodity because I ran fast breaks well and could beat most people off the dribble.</p>

<p>However, I was a terrible shooter, and over time the opposition accounted for my strengths and forced me to my weaknesses. For a period of maybe a few weeks, the defense would leave me wide open from 15 feet out and I would be double teamed if I drove into the paint. This strategy effectively forced me to shoot long jumpers.</p>

<p>Initially, I took the bait only because my teammates screamed at me to shoot, not realizing how much I sucked at shooting. As the realization sunk in that I could not shoot, I stopped getting the ball and one teammate specifically gave me a hard time for being useless - let&rsquo;s call him Ron. For Ron, every game was personal, and he had an unhealthy devotion to winning. I clearly was getting in the way of Ron&rsquo;s love of winning, and he took to some bush-league name calling and other tactics as a result.</p>

<p>For a while, I hated coming to the gym because Ron would endlessly taunt me and demand I not be on his team. I understood the source of the conflict - Ron thought (correctly for some time) I endangered his team&rsquo;s chances of winning. I grew to hate Ron and swore that I would become an assassin jump shooter to shut him the hell up.</p>

<p>In my quest to end this emotional conflict, I took to going to the gym every weekend and shooting jumpers for several hours. In pick-up games, I made a concerted effort to only take jumpers and work on the one area of my game that needed major help. Over time, I saw significant improvement.</p>

<p>One game, in part due to Ron&rsquo;s shenanigans, I ended up on a team with no one who could score, where endless passing was the norm and all were afraid to shoot. It dawned on me I should use this situation as the staging ground for my coming out party as a shooter.</p>

<p>I began to shoot with impunity, catching and aiming as soon as I received the ball. I think I hit four threes that game and clearly recall Ron&rsquo;s jaw dropping. Most guys (Ron included) dismissed the performance as an aberration, but as I continued to add consistency to my shooting game, I heard Ron&rsquo;s chatter die down. One of my most satisfying experiences at the JCC was Ron coming up to me after a particularly good performance and saying, &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve made yourself into a respectable shooter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m proud of myself for how I dealt with Ron. I never shit-talked back, and I responded purely with my actions. I gained his respect and am a better basketball player (and person) for deciding to respond with my actions and not my words. I handled myself like a pro (Tim Duncan comes to mind), and I can look back on the memories of working on my jump-shooting with a smile.</p>
