title: Favorite Books
---

I always appreciate when people share their favorite books with me, so I figured I'd do the same here. In no particular order...  [(because trying to rate a book is akin to trying to rate a poem)] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpeLSMKNFO4)

* [The Soul of a New Machine, Tracy Kidder](http://www.amazon.com/The-Soul-A-New-Machine/dp/0316491977) - Kidder won the Pulitzer in 1981 for this book and it's a truly incredible story. Kidder has more or less full access to all members of a team of engineers and managers at Data General as they develop a new computer. The sheer complexity of the task at hand is both overwhelming and beautiful. Kidder has written a long-lasting testament to engineers' ability to cope with unique problems. 

* [How Life Imitates Chess, Garry Kasparov] (http://www.amazon.com/How-Life-Imitates-Chess-Boardroom/dp/1596913886) - worth it just to read the section on Kasparov's five month duel with Karpov in 1984. Consider that for a second - two human beings played chess at the most elite level possible over five months (spanning 48 games). That's a longer time period than the entire playoffs for a ll the major sports. Moreover, Kasparov discussing (i) the experience of playing Deep Blue and (ii) [facing the world in an online match over four months](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasparov_versus_the_World) are particular treats. I really feel Gary Kasparov's contributions to chess are equivalent to Donald Knuth in computer science. Both have contributed so much to the world and put their contributions in an understable form.


* [Hackers and Painters, Paul Graham] 	(http://www.amazon.com/Hackers-Painters-Big-Ideas-Computer/dp/1449389554) - significantly more than entertaining essays on technology. Paul Graham's thoughts on education, politics / religion, growing up [(this essay on nerds is one of my favorites)](http://www.paulgraham.com/nerds.html),etc. all represent a significant break from the norm.  Also, the footnotes are wildly entertaining.

* [Extra Lives: Why Video Games Matter, Tom Bissel](http://www.amazon.com/Extra-Lives-Video-Games-Matter/dp/0307474313) - prior to this collection of essays, I had read nothing reaching this level of eloquence on the sensory experience of playing video games. And it would be enough of Bissel just watched poetic on playing - he goes out into the field and interviews all types of game-makers, talking about the decisions surrounding the design process, the future of the industy, the impact of games on the mind, etc. 

* [Benjamin Franklin: An American Life, Walter Isaacson](http://www.amazon.com/Benjamin-Franklin-An-American-Life/dp/074325807X) I read this one after hearing Elon Musk cite it as a book that impacted him in an interview. Musk has said that what he admires about Franklin is that ["he just thought about what are the problems that need to get solved and worked on those".](http://www.businessinsider.com/people-who-inspire-the-worlds-most-innovative-billionaire-2013-3) 

	Indeed, it's really a weird wrinkle of history that one of history's greatest scientists was called upon to play an integral role during the American Revolution. The question of American independence was one Franklin initially did not see as pressing, and his ability to shift gears accordingly and play the most crucial of parts in 1776 is intimately detailed by Isaacson.
