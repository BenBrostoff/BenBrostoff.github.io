title: Favorite Books
---

I always appreciate when people share their favorite books with me, so I figured I'd do the same here. In no particular order ([because trying to rate a book is akin to trying to rate a poem] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpeLSMKNFO4))

1. The Soul of a New Machine, Tracy Kidder 

2. Hackers and Painters, Paul Graham] 	(http://www.amazon.com/Hackers-Painters-Big-Ideas-Computer/dp/1449389554) - significantly more than entertaining essays on techonology. Paul Graham's thoughts on education, politics / religion, growing up, etc. all represent a significant break from the norm. Also, the footnotes are wildly entertaining.

3. Why Video Games Matter, Tom Bissel

4. Benjamin Franklin, Walter Isaacson

5. The Everything Store, Brad Stone

6. How Life Imitates Chess, Garry Kasparov
