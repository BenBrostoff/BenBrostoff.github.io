               	 <h1 class = "warning">Brostoff: A Background</h1>
                 <p>I am a 24 year old aspiring software engineer and ex-banker. My passions include Boston sports and Mad Men (only 14 more episodes!).</p>
                 <p>I consider computers and the internet the most important inventions of the last century. From an educational perspective (and a being a human being perspective), I feel I woul be amiss if I did not learn how to code well. Computer science is the closest thing we have to magic in our world.</p>
                 <h2 class = "warning">Chess</h2>
                  <p>I am a fair to middling chess player with little knowledge of opening theory and a horrific grasp of the end game. I do think it's cool a world championship match between Kasparov and Karpov lasted 5 months. Consider that we get restless when there's a power outage at the Super Bowl. <i>What I really find interesting about chess relative to other sports though, is it is virtually impossible in a game between GMs to tell who is winning at any given point in the middle game</i>. Not many sports where it's not readily apparent who is winning.</p>
                  <p> Who is winning? </p>
                  <h3 class = "warning">Matt Damon</h3>
                   <p>If I could be one person for a day it would likely be Matt Damon.<br> That's right. <p id = "damon"> Matt Damon. </p> <p>I'd want to cherry pick scripts and go to important Red Sox games. I've seen Good Will Hunting over 40 times; I've seen Happy Gilmore > 100 times. The bar room scene in Good Will Hunting gets me every time. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ymsHLkB8u3s" target="_blank">Yah, I read that too.</a></p>
