<h2 class = "blogheading"> May 7, 2014 - Stereotype Threat</h2>

<div class="blogpost">

<p class = "blogpost">I'll begin by getting the obvious out of the way - I'm a white, heterosexual male who would be difficult to pick out of a lineup. I acknowledge fully I have never experienced <a "href http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereotype_threat" target="_blank"> stereotype threat</a> and consequently would be unable to relate to someone who has. </p>

<p class = "blogpost">I am comfortable enough to say I am probably someone who has certain expectations upon meeting another person These expectations are one part experience and one part my own media consumption (or some mixture thereof). They are what I think of as "generic" assumptions, but nonetheless, they are no doubt assumptions that feed into stereotype threat.</p>

<p class = "blogpost">I can remember feelings upon meeting certain people that confirm this suspicion. The first time I played in a morning basketball scrimmage at my local JCC, I assumed the black guy was the best player. He was. When I walked into my multi-variate calculus class in college, I assumed the Asians were math majors and the white kids were economics majors (multi-variate was a required course for economics majors at Duke). That assumption was swiftly proved false. When I discovered my associate at my first job was a muscle-bound, New Jersey native, I thought the only thing we'd have in common would be sports. We found common ground on cooking, fiction, travel - and, among other things, sports. I've found my assumptions turn out to be right, wrong and a mix of both.</p>

<p class = "blogpost">It's not a popular thing to say, but there are times stereotypes can be useful - a super athletic black guy in your morning scrimmage should be guarded closely if you're on defense - a slightly overweight, Jewish guy (like myself), less so. I'd like to think I change my assumptions over time as they are proved / disproved. Again, exceptions exist everywhere, but it's nice to have somewhere to start when trying to do business or form friendships with new people. If you have a passion for German history, you would be well advised to tread lightly around a Jewish person. I don't believe this is deliberate stereotyping - it's common courtesy and, to a certain extent, calculated empathy (<e class="g"></e>. as a practicing Jew, I can say most Jewish people, including myself, feel annoyed when we hear car enthusiasts trumpeting the merits of BMW without mentioning the company's role in WWII).</p>

<p class = "blogpost">Yet, assumptions are the basis of stereotype threat - there is no threat without assumptions.</p>


<p class = "blogpost">It seems to me, though, that there is no realistic means of totally eliminating assumptions. Every minority has to deal with stereotype threat. It is an unpleasant fact of life, but a reality. Although I cannot speak from experience on stereotype threat specifically, I find the unpleasant facts of life are best dealt with by facing them head-on and realizing they are unavoidable. </p>

<p class = "blogpost">I believe I can do my small part to negate the impact of stereotype threat by keeping my assumptions to myself initially, and changing them accordingly as the facts present themselves (let's recall not all stereotypes lead to negative baseline assumptions - indeed, it seems to be the case that certain minorities are excellent at certain jobs, and the numbers don't deny this argument - consider Jews' overrepresentation in comedy and finance relative to their representation on an absolute basis in the US). The best way to defuse the threat of stereotype is to weigh the (ever-changing) reality against the stereotype itself.</p>

<p class = "blogpost">Indeed, realities change quickly, and so should our assumptions. </p>
