<blockquote>In a curious way, they show more spontaneity and more pleasure, and seem far less relentlessly organized, than many students now attending the better colleges and universities. Is it the absence of hand-holding — the sense that they are on their own — that has given them something of the freedom of college forty or fifty years ago?</blockquote>

The above quote is from a NYT Review of Books article by David Bromwich, [which can be found here.](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/aug/14/hi-tech-mess-higher-education/) "They" is in reference to "persons of college age" on scholarships awarded by Peter Thiel. Recipients of such scholarships educate themselves.

I graduated from Duke University with a B.S. in Economics two years ago; I graduated from Dev Bootcamp yesterday. I do not have, nor do I expect to receive, a [Thiel Fellowship](http://www.thielfellowship.org/). I can say with complete honesty, however, that I feel more spontaneous, satisfied and organized in the aftermath of this graduation than the one before it.

I do not intend for this post to be a commentary on the current state of higher education, or even the state of bootcamp education. Rather, I want to talk broadly about (i) learning and (ii) motivation, and the connection I see between the two based on my experiences at Duke and at DBC.

I believe learning to be very much intertwined with what people find personally meaningful. This opinion has some scientific basis, as there is research to support that memory persists longer depending on the associations one makes with the memory. For example, if I were to tell you that a certain number will unlock a safe containing a life-saving antidote to a life-threatening virus, and you believed me to be credible, you would likely remember that number. However, if I just spit out a random number, I doubt you would remember it five minutes later.

In a classroom setting, this idea is especially relevant. I can recall dozens of instances in college of a student asking, "Will this be on the test?" Memory (and, by extension, learning, although the two are not synonymous) in higher education is all too often dependent on arbitrary incentives. GPA is the vehicle by which students signal to employers their worth; GPA is founded on correct answers to tests; correct answers to tests derive from learning and memorization. Thus, students are highly incentivized to learn what the test will "look like", and prepare accordingly.

Learning and motivation are completely different in the context of the bootcamp model (and, to be clear, I can only speak to DBC here). Most students in my DBC cohort felt compelled to learn what would help them achieve their goals or satisfy their curiousity. Yes, DBC has a large and well planned curriculum, as well as tri-weekly assessments, but the curriculum and asessments (in my opinion) seem to supplement learning rather than direct it. I would deep dive into parts of the DBC curriculum if they were useful for a project I happened to be working on.

A pertinent example: my final group project for DBC was a mobile responsive e-reading platform called ReadyReader (here's the [live site](http://ready-reader.herokuapp.com/) if you're interested). One of the biggest problems our group encountered was slow performance and a frozen UX during book uploads. We mined the DBC curriculum and our instructors for knowledge on performance optimization, background jobs and relevant tools in order to solve our performance issues. Our studies eventually led us to [Redis](http://redis.io/) and [Resque](https://github.com/resque/resque), which performed the background database work we needed without interrupting the user experience. In short, the mechanism that directed our learning was solving a problem rather than preparing for a test or optimizing GPA.

Moreover, our group created the problem that led to our learning. We all wanted to work on an e-reader, and the project was personally meaningful to us. We also all made the conscious choice to pay a good chunk of change to be at DBC and pursue software engineering. Therein lies the crucial difference between colleges / universities and bootcamps (and yes, I realize these are general statements that do not apply to all students): 

- In a college / university setting, learning and motivation are founded upon test structure and GPA optimization
- In a bootcamp setting, learning and motivation are founded upon solving personally meaningful problems

I think this discrepancy is the reason why Thiel Fellowship recipients seem so much more motivated than college students. When an individual makes a conscious choice to tackle a problem, he or she is infinitely more motivated to find a solution than when the problem is created by another individual. 

Were I to offer one reform for higher education, it would be to recognize this principle and factor it into decision-making processes. Students will work hard for themselves. They will work less hard for others. 

Learning is inseparable from motivation.
