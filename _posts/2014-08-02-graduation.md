<blockquote>In a curious way, they show more spontaneity and more pleasure, and seem far less relentlessly organized, than many students now attending the better colleges and universities. Is it the absence of hand-holding — the sense that they are on their own — that has given them something of the freedom of college forty or fifty years ago?</blockquote>

The above quote is from a NYT Review of Books article by David Bromwich, [which can be found here.](http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2014/aug/14/hi-tech-mess-higher-education/) "They" is in reference to "persons of college age" on scholarships awarded by Peter Thiel. Recipients of such scholarships educate themselves.

I graduated from Duke University with a B.S. in Economics two years ago; I graduated from Dev Bootcamp yesterday. I do not have, nor do I expect to receive, a [Thiel Fellowship](http://www.thielfellowship.org/). I can say with complete honesty, however, that I feel more spontaneous, satisfied and organized in the aftermath of this graduation than the one before it.

I do not intend for this post to be a commentary on the current state of higher education, or even the state of bootcamp education. Rather, I want to talk broadly about (i) learning and (ii) motivation, and the connection I see between the two based on my experiences at Duke and at DBC.
