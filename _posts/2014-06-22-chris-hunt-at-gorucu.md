Chris Hunt gave an excellent talk on improving working memory at yesterday's [GORUCU](http://goruco.com/) conference. I've read part of Harry Lorayne's and Jerry Lucas' classic book on improving [memory](http://www.amazon.com/The-Memory-Book-Classic-Improving/dp/0345337581), so some of the techniques Chris promoted were familiar to me. However, his real-world examples of using the locus method and mnemonics demonstrated implementation of these methods in an easy-to-understand way. I find it interesting and not at all coincidental that Chris is a world-class [programmer](https://github.com/chrishunt) at GitHub and a memory enthusiast.

My admittedly limited programming experience has hammered home the value of working memory in a programming context. Although Sublime or your text editor of choice will provide suggested variables / methods / classes / etc. given the first letter you type, it can't be stressed enough how easy it is to forget names you wrote in a large program. Popping open another file or scrolling up or down to figure out what I named method X has destroyed my [flow state](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology) on numerous occasions. 

What benefits could 10 minutes a day of working memory exercises deliver to my programming productivity? I certainly believe it's worth finding out. Chris recommended this week by week memory [improvement guide](http://www.amazon.com/How-Develop-Brilliant-Memory-Week/dp/1780287909) by multi-time world memory champion [Dominic O'Brien](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominic_O'Brien), as well as <i>[Moonwalking with Einstein](http://www.amazon.com/Moonwalking-Einstein-Science-Remembering-Everything/dp/0143120530)</i> by Josh Foer. The latter book details Foer's journey from a science journalist studying memory to 2006 USA World Memory Champion. The time investment here is relatively small (reading two books and putting aside 10 minutes a day) and the payoffs are potentially enormous.  

Funnily enough, Chris' talk itself served as an incredible example of the benefits to be had from working on your working memory. He was the only speaker at the entire conference who never looked behind him to refer to the big screen and spoke in coherent, complete, polished sentences that in retrospect seemed pre-written (but his delivery was such that it sounded anything but canned - the guy is also a grade A public speaker). The talk was filled with lists of multiple items and heavy on specific references (e.g. several cards in a playing deck and numerous names were referenced throughout). The strength of Chris Hunt's own working memory could not have been more apparent than in this talk.  

I'm still in awe of how bad-ass those fifteen minutes were. Here's to you, Chris Hunt.
