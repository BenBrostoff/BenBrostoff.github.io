title: Think Like a Programmer

Last week marked my first at [Dev Bootcamp](http://devbootcamp.com/), and my main takeaway from Week 1 is that I need to change the approach I have to solving programming problems.

Our Week 1 challenges consisted largely of building functions that could take any argument of a certain type (e.g. unsolved Sudoku board) and convert them to a specific format with specific constraints (e.g. solved Sudoku board). Such challenges included:

* Converting any Arabic number to a Roman numeral format
* Converting any Arabic number to English words
* Converting a given Boggle board and a word to a true / false output depending on whether the board contained the word
* And, of course, the aforementioned Sudoku challenge

I found all these problems required a certain cognitive discipline. One must be able to look at several instances, find relationships among the instances, find the exceptions to the relationships and then code the findings. 

Interestingly (and not coincidentally, of course), all of the solutions to the challenges could be implemented recursively. I tried to solve all of them iteratively before seeing the light. 

As time has progressed and I've read more code, I've started to begin to understand the "hackiness" of certain solutions to problems. Any time I find myself writing a line that looks similar to the line above it, or a loop with nearly the exact same characteristics as a loop I wrote earlier in a program, I'll think back to Week 1 and the elegance of the solutions our instructors offered on the aforementioned problems. 

Moreover, I want to make it a priority to not even write these lines of code in the first place by writing better pseudocode (although to be fair, sometimes writing initial hacky solutions helps me see the more concise solution). The mindset of good programmers it seems to me is to understand at all points in time the logical consequences of each line of code, as well as the "work" each line is doing (e.g. a recursive call does significant work - each nested for loop less so). I hope to think more like a good programmer as I progress through the next eight weeks of camp.
