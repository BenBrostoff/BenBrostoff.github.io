title: A Highly Entertaining Spat

Mommy and Daddy have been fighting lately in the Twitter equivalent of the Brostoff household. I woke up this morning to the following:

Before we go any further - there's no actual animosity here I'm sure, and I think all this tweeting is in good jest. As background, the [Epicurean Deal Maker](http://epicureandealmaker.blogspot.com/) and [Marc Andreessen](http://blog.pmarca.com/) are two people I greatly admire and relate to as a former banker turned software engineer. I was a religious reader of EDM during my two years as an investment banker; I remember reading ["Why Software Is Eating the World"](http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460) in August 2011 in the WSJ, and Marc Andreeseen is at least part of the reason for the career change I recently made. 

So, I've taken a rather large interest in their mildy heated (lukewarm?) Twitter exchanges of late. I actually was in the middle of one of them:

The particular feud I happened to get in the middle of started with a [blogpost](http://epicureandealmaker.blogspot.com/2014/08/where-did-he-learn-to-negotiate-like.html) EDM wrote on 8/2. The post suggests that Trulia - an online residential real estate website - was mistreated by its former advisor, Qatalyst Partners. Trulia had originally engaged Qatalyst three years ago to negotiate the sale of the company to Zillow, and failed to legally end the engagment when the sale fell through at the time. EDM's claim to me seems [to have merit](http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/07/29/old-attempt-to-sell-trulia-rewards-ex-adviser-qatalyst-now/), as Qatalyst (i) charged Trulia off-market fees and (ii) likely destroyed [Trulia shareholder value](https://twitter.com/EpicureanDeal/status/496991408071643136) (albeit created Qatalyst shareholder value). 

In short, I read EDM's argument on Qatalyst and found it to be extremely reasonable and well grounded. Because I agreed with the post, I by extension felt inclined to agree with EDM that two Qatalyst bankers - George Boutros and Frank Quattrone - perhaps did not have their clients' best interests at heart. I ending up eating my words because I tried to comment on a subject I was not qualified to comment on. I do not personally know either banker; Marc Andreessen does, and was right to put me in my place.

To my credit, however, I admitted my lack of knowledge on Frank Quattrone and George Boutros and earned some Twitter karma:

My banking idol has yet to do so - in part because he is qualified to comment on what he writes on - and thus, the @pmarca v. @epicureandeal Twitter wars wage on. I find this spat interesting because I believe it has deep roots in the way certain types of people view technological progress. 

I would theorize that EDM's most recent tweet on the misguided and relentless enthusiasm of techies was in part influenced by Andreessen's Tweet-heavy celebration of [Lyft Line](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/07/technology/personaltech/lyft-tries-to-coax-commuters-to-leave-their-cars.html?_r=0). This celebration culminated in a 12-tweet praisefest that can be found [here](https://twitter.com/pngmarca/status/497155377100619777/photo/1). Moreover, the @pmarca feed is a frequent source of technological optimism. Par for the course are tweets documenting groundbreaking work in tech:

In contrast, EDM is the venerable Scrooge of my Twitter feed.

<blockquote>
Now I understand that the technology world operates in its own reality distortion field, but I have to confess I was stunned by that fee percentage. In the normal business world, where industrial logic and economic pressures operate in place of the moonbeams and unicorn piss of tech land, a billion dollar sale mandate should earn the sell-side advisor flogging it significantly less than one percent of transaction value.

The extremes could not be more clear. Marc
